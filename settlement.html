    <p>
      Settlement on GANT is designed to remove uncertainty from cross-border grain trade. 
      Every transaction moves through a governed set of rules that protect both sides, anchor pricing, 
      and ensure predictable fund movement. Instead of manual negotiation or counterparty exposure, 
      settlement is structured, instant and tied to verified corridor conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>1. How settlement works</h2>

    <div class="section-block">
      <p><strong>Escrow backed bidding</strong></p>
      <p>
        Every buyer bid is secured by a mandatory 20 percent escrow deposit. This prevents phantom orders and ensures 
        only committed bids proceed. When the Corridor Risk Engine approves the bid, settlement becomes instant.  
        Funds move to the farmer and the buyer receives immediate access to their shipment documentation and QR metadata.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Release of funds</strong></p>
      <p>
        Funds are released as soon as the corridor is approved. This model pays farmers instantly without waiting for 
        logistics or delivery, while ensuring buyers only settle into safe corridors.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Governance that controls settlement</h2>

    <div class="section-block">
      <p><strong>Corridor threshold governance</strong></p>
      <p>
        Each corridor is continuously scored using structured, publicly available data. 
        Green and yellow corridors settle normally.  
        Orange or red corridors can trigger limits or pauses until conditions stabilize.  
        This protects both sides from settling during extreme risk events.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Defined platform rules</strong></p>
      <p>
        All trades follow a uniform governance framework—escrow rules, corridor scoring, standardized documentation, 
        identity-preserved lots and verified warehouse data. There is no negotiation or special handling.  
        Every participant interacts with the same rule set.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>3. Why settlement is instant only after corridor approval</h2>

    <div class="section-block">
      <p>
        Traditional trade mixes payment with logistics risk. GANT separates both.  
        Once a trade passes corridor checks, settlement happens instantly and the grain becomes the buyer’s property.  
        Logistics follow later under EXW terms.  
        This keeps financial settlement clean, predictable and insulated from disruptions during transportation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>4. What buyers receive after settlement</h2>

    <div class="section-block">
      <p>
        After settlement, buyers receive a single QR code for their full order, access to quality results, 
        compliance documents,live tracking of goods, access to the dynamic shipment risk engine, warehouse conditions, sustainability information and an export-ready document pack.  
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>5. What farmers receive after settlement</h2>

    <div class="section-block">
      <p>
        Farmers are paid instantly once a bid is approved.  
        They receive predictable outcomes, no negotiation, and a fully handled documentation workflow.  
        This allows them to focus on production while the platform manages the verification and compliance layers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>6. Governance for institutional stakeholders</h2>

    <div class="section-block">
      <p>
        Governments, regulators and institutional buyers receive transparent corridor logic, 
        validated document packs and access to historical records.  
        GANT creates a dependable compliance environment that strengthens the integrity of agritrade corridors.
