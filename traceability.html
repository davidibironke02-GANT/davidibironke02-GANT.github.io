    <h1>Traceability Architecture</h1>

    <p>
      Traceability is a core part of how GANT operates. Buyers should always know the quality, handling conditions, and journey behind every shipment they purchase. Our traceability architecture is built to provide that visibility in a clear and structured way, without flooding you with unnecessary technical data.
    </p>

    <h2>Lot Identity Begins in Our Facility</h2>
    <p>
      Every shipment starts with a verified production lot. Grain is processed using export-grade cleaning, drying, and handling systems. Each batch receives a distinct identity linked to its grade, moisture levels, quality profile, and any sustainability practices provided by the farmer. This single identity follows the product throughout its lifecycle.
    </p>

    <h2>Pallet-Level Records and Storage History</h2>
    <p>
      Once processed, grain is bagged, palletized, and labelled with an internal tracking code. The system maintains a documented record showing how long each pallet remained in storage and summarizing the temperature and humidity conditions during that period. Buyers receive a clean storage summary that confirms proper handling prior to export.
    </p>

    <h2>Decision-Grade Information Before You Bid</h2>
    <p>
      Before placing a bid, buyers can review key information attached to each listing:
      <br><br>
      • Verified quality results  
      • Storage environment summaries  
      • Sustainability and farming practice indicators, where available  
      • The Verified Value Index score  
      • Corridor-level macro risk for the intended route  
      <br><br>
      This gives you the visibility needed to compare lots confidently and make informed procurement decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Shipment Identity and QR Assignment</h2>
    <p>
      When your bid is approved through corridor-level risk checks, a single shipment identity is created. During container loading, a QR code is assigned to all pallets within your shipment. This QR code becomes the access point to your complete shipment record once the goods arrive at their destination.
    </p>

    <h2>Container Monitoring During Transit</h2>
    <p>
      A compact, single-use IoT device is placed inside each export container. It monitors temperature, humidity, route alignment, shocks, and major movement deviations. The purpose is not to overwhelm you with raw sensor data, but to maintain a clear and reliable journey summary that supports logistics, insurance, and dispute resolution if needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Risk Interpretation Throughout the Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Two layers of risk intelligence work together:
      <br><br>
      • <strong>Corridor Risk Engine:</strong> Evaluates tariff conditions, geopolitical developments, environmental factors, and other publicly available corridor-related signals.  
      • <strong>Dynamic Shipment Risk Engine:</strong> Summarizes container conditions and route behavior into an easy-to-understand color signal with a short explanation.
      <br><br>
      Buyers receive simple, decision-grade interpretations rather than technical data dumps.
    </p>

    <h2>Full Visibility at Delivery</h2>
    <p>
      When your shipment arrives, you scan the QR code on the pallet. Instantly, you gain access to:
      <br><br>
      • Lot and quality information  
      • Storage condition summaries  
      • Export documentation  
      • Shipment journey summary  
      • Verified chain-of-custody from our facility to yours  
      <br><br>
      This removes the need to request documentation from multiple parties. Everything is stored in one place and accessible the moment your goods arrive.
