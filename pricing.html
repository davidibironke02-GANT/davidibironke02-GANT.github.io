    <h1>Pricing Algorithm</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Visibility</h2>
    <p>
      The GANT Pricing Algorithm is designed to surface smallholders and sustainable producers who are often marginalized in traditional markets. 
      Each lot carries a <strong>Visibility Score</strong>, which prioritizes farmers based on size, ESG certification, reliability, and delivery history. 
      This ensures that smallholders and cooperatives are not drowned out by industrial players, and that markets reward trust and sustainability.
    </p>

    <h2>Pricing Logic</h2>
    <p>
      At its core, the algorithm applies <strong>progressive pricing</strong> to prevent dominance by a few large players. 
      Farmers who are ESG-compliant pay a standard 3% fee, while non-ESG farmers pay 4%, with the extra 1% ring-fenced into the Transition Fund. 
      Once a corridor reaches scale, additional progressive fees are applied based on a participant’s market share, ensuring no single entity can distort prices 
      while channeling growth into ESG adoption and smallholder resilience.
    </p>

    <h2>Proximity to Trade</h2>
    <p>
      When bids and asks are tied, the system gives preference to producers located closer to the delivery point. 
      This logic reduces transport costs, strengthens local food networks, and lowers emissions by rewarding <strong>shorter corridors</strong>. 
      Farmers benefit from reduced logistics risk, while buyers gain fresher, more reliable supplies that align with sustainability targets.
    </p>

    <h2>Phantom Order Protection & Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      Every bid on GANT is escrow-backed, eliminating phantom orders and guaranteeing that all trades are genuine. 
      Coupled with real-time dashboards that display corridor prices, bid/ask depth, and ESG fund inflows, 
      the system creates a level of transparency unseen in traditional markets. 
      Farmers, buyers, governments, and regulators can all verify that trade is fair, compliant, and sustainable.
