    <h1>THE GANT EXCHANGE MODEL</h1>
  </div>

  <!-- Exchange Section -->
  <section>
    <p>
      The global agritrade sector grapples with systemic inefficiencies that undermine its potential: fragmented supply chains, opaque pricing mechanisms, protracted settlement cycles, and pervasive risks from fraud to volatility. These issues erode trust, impose disproportionate costs on producers—often absorbing 30-40% in middlemen margins—and expose buyers to unreliable supply and compliance uncertainties. In an era where food security and sustainability are paramount, such barriers not only stifle economic growth but also perpetuate inequities, leaving small-scale producers marginalized in a market dominated by intermediaries. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where GANT intervenes: to architect a transformative platform that restores transparency, equity, and resilience, enabling agritrade to function as a seamless, value-driven ecosystem. GANT’s exchange model is engineered as a sophisticated, blockchain-enabled marketplace that orchestrates end-to-end transactions with precision and security. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The process commences with producers listing their commodities on the platform, providing essential details on quantity, quality, and origin. These listings are designed to integrate seamlessly with real-time market dynamics, allowing buyers to engage through a bid/ask system that reflects genuine supply and demand. Bids are submitted above a dynamic floor price, calibrated to corridor-specific factors, ensuring fair valuation from the outset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a bid placement, funds are immediately escrowed through smart contracts on the blockchain, locking commitments and eliminating the possibility of phantom bids or speculative manipulation. The platform’s Market Matching Engine then executes pairings in real-time, prioritizing optimal alignments based on price, volume, and producer reputation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To mitigate inherent risks, the Corridor Risk Engine—an advanced AI system—conducts instantaneous evaluations of geopolitical, logistical, and environmental factors, dynamically rerouting or flagging trades that exceed predefined thresholds. This proactive layer not only safeguards participants but also enhances overall market stability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following a successful match, producers transport goods to a designated Collection Center, where rigorous verification processes confirm adherence to quality and compliance standards. Once validated, funds are released from escrow to the producer in a T+1 settlement cycle, converted at market rates without hidden fees. Buyers, in turn, receive comprehensive digital documentation and initiate real-time tracking of the shipment, empowered by IoT integration for visibility from dispatch to delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      This streamlined flow reduces latency, minimizes disputes, and fosters a cycle of trust that scales with each transaction. GANT transforms agritrade by embedding intelligence, security, and fairness into every exchange, creating a resilient platform that adapts to the complexities of global markets. Through this model, we not only address today’s inefficiencies but also pave the way for a sustainable, inclusive future in agriculture—one trade at a time.
