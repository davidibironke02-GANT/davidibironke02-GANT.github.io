    <h1>Financing Model for Buyers</h1>
  </div>

  <!-- CONTENT -->
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Why We Offer Financing</h2>
    <p>
      Long trade corridors, ocean freight and global procurement cycles can put pressure on working capital. 
      The GANT financing model is designed to help serious buyers secure Canadian grain while preserving liquidity. 
      You focus on your logistics and customer markets. Our fintech partner provides structured support on the trade and freight side.
    </p>

    <h2>EX Works: You Control Your Logistics</h2>
    <p>
      All trades on GANT are EX Works from our facility in Calgary. You select and manage your own logistics end to end. 
      This includes domestic transport, port handling, ocean freight, insurance, destination port charges, duties and final delivery to your site.
    </p>
    <p>
      GANT prepares the product, verifies quality and documentation, and hands over the shipment at our facility. 
      You choose your carriers, routes and timing.
    </p>

    <h2>Two Ways to Finance a Purchase</h2>
    <p>
      Buyers can either fund trades directly or use the financing support available through our partner. 
      The structure is intentionally simple.
    </p>

    <h2>Option A: Direct Purchase With Full Payment</h2>
    <p>
      Under this option, you fund the full trade value from your own balance sheet.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You place a bid on a specific lot.</li>
      <li>Twenty percent of the trade value is committed as a deposit when you submit your bid.</li>
      <li>The remaining 80 percent is settled according to the agreed terms once the trade is confirmed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The 20 percent deposit prevents abandoned orders and confirms that the lot is reserved for you while corridor conditions and documentation are finalised.
    </p>

    <h2>Option B: Financed Purchase With Credit Support</h2>
    <p>
      For buyers who prefer to preserve cash or smooth out payment cycles, our fintech partner can provide structured credit coverage.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You place a bid with a 20 percent deposit, the same as in the direct model.</li>
      <li>The fintech partner can finance up to 80 percent of the trade value.</li>
      <li>In addition, they can finance up to 100 percent of eligible logistics costs, including inland transport, port handling and ocean freight.</li>
      <li>Repayment is made using post dated cheques or other agreed instruments, aligned with your internal cash flow planning.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The objective is straightforward. You secure product and logistics capacity today without locking up all of your capital on day one.
    </p>

    <h2>What GANT Does Not Do</h2>
    <p>
      GANT does not operate as a freight broker and does not control your shipping decisions. 
      We do not mark up logistics costs, we do not own vessels and we do not insert additional intermediaries into your supply chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our role is focused on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Preparing export grade product.</li>
      <li>Maintaining traceable lot and shipment records.</li>
      <li>Providing a transparent trading venue.</li>
      <li>Coordinating with the fintech partner on settlement signals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pricing And Platform Fees For Buyers</h2>
    <p>
      Buyers on GANT do not pay a platform fee. Your costs are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The trade price that you agree for each lot.</li>
      <li>The cost of your chosen logistics providers under EX Works terms.</li>
      <li>Any financing costs that apply when you use the credit line.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Fees are disclosed clearly and are tied to the financing product rather than the trading platform itself. 
      The aim is to keep your cost structure predictable and easy to allocate internally.
    </p>

    <h2>Who This Model Is Designed For</h2>
    <p>
      The financing model is designed for buyers who operate in structured environments. 
      This includes mills, food manufacturers, aggregators, cooperatives and institutional buyers who need reliable supply and clear documentation, but who also want flexibility in how they deploy capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Credit availability, limits and terms depend on your onboarding profile, trade history and the assessment made by the fintech partner. 
      GANT does not make credit decisions. We provide the infrastructure that connects trade, traceability and financing in a single workflow.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Approach Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional instruments like letters of credit can be slow and administratively heavy. 
      Our goal is to give buyers a faster, more transparent way to secure grain and move it across borders, without losing the protections and discipline that serious institutions expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      By separating logistics control, trade execution and financing into clear roles, we keep the system simple. 
      You retain control of your routes and carriers. The fintech partner provides structured funding where it makes sense. 
      GANT ensures that the underlying product and documentation standard stay consistent.
