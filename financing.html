    <h1>Financing Model</h1>
  </div>

  <!-- CONTENT -->
  <div class="container">

    <h2>Why We Offer Financing</h2>
    <p>
      Agriculture is capital intensive at every stage. Whether you are producing grain or moving it across borders, cash flow timing can determine how quickly you grow. Our financing structure is built to support both sides of the market. Farmers receive liquidity without waiting for a buyer. Buyers preserve working capital while securing high quality Canadian grain. 
    </p>

    <!-- FARMER SECTION FIRST (Option B) -->
    <h2>Financing for Farmers</h2>
    <p>
      Farmers often wait weeks or months to receive payment when selling through traditional channels. By the time grain is transported, graded, shipped and paid for, important opportunities for reinvestment may already be gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      On GANT, our fintech partner allows farmers to access <strong>40 to 50 percent advance financing</strong> as soon as their grain is processed and stored in our facility. The grain itself serves as collateral, which means no additional paperwork, no bank visits and no long approval cycles.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Immediate working capital after delivery to our facility.</li>
      <li>No repayment scheduling. The advance is automatically settled when the batch is sold.</li>
      <li>Freedom to set your own price and wait for the right buyer without cash pressure.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This structure helps farmers manage seasonal expenses, stabilize operations and plan ahead without relying on traditional lenders or selling early at discounted prices.
    </p>

    <!-- BUYER SECTION -->
    <h2>Financing for Buyers</h2>
    <p>
      Cross-border procurement and logistics require upfront capital. To help buyers secure supply while maintaining liquidity, our fintech partner offers flexible financing tied directly to each trade.
    </p>

    <h2>Two Ways to Finance a Purchase</h2>

    <h2>Option A: Direct Purchase</h2>
    <p>
      Buyers can fund trades directly. A <strong>20 percent deposit</strong> is committed when placing a bid, with the remaining balance settled according to agreed terms once the trade is confirmed.
    </p>

    <h2>Option B: Financed Purchase</h2>
    <p>
      Buyers who prefer to preserve capital can use our partner’s structured credit support.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Twenty percent deposit confirms the order.</li>
      <li>Up to <strong>80 percent of the trade value</strong> can be financed.</li>
      <li>Up to <strong>100 percent of logistics costs</strong> can be financed, including inland transport, port handling and ocean freight.</li>
      <li>Repayment is made through post dated cheques or other agreed instruments.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This allows buyers to secure supply and logistics capacity today while aligning payments with downstream cash flow.
    </p>

    <h2>EX Works: You Control Your Logistics</h2>
    <p>
      All trades on GANT are completed on an EX Works basis from our Calgary facility. You choose your carriers, shipping routes, insurance, and timing. We prepare verified product and documentation, and you take full control of the logistics process from our door forward.
    </p>

    <h2>Platform Fees for Buyers</h2>
    <p>
      Buyers do not pay a platform fee. Your direct costs are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The price you agree to pay for the grain.</li>
      <li>Your chosen logistics expenses under EX Works.</li>
      <li>Optional financing charges if using the credit line.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What GANT Does Not Do</h2>
    <p>
      We do not act as a freight broker, do not manage logistics on your behalf, and do not insert intermediaries into your supply chain. Our role is to maintain verified product quality, traceability and documentation while enabling financing where needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Who This Model Supports</h2>
    <p>
      The financing model supports farmers who want early liquidity and buyers who need structured capital support for procurement. Mills, food producers, aggregators, cooperatives and institutional buyers will find this model especially useful.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Approach Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional instruments such as letters of credit can be slow and administratively heavy. Our financing approach removes delays, simplifies documentation and keeps capital moving efficiently while preserving full control for both producers and buyers.
