    <h1>Corridor & Shipment Risk Intelligence</h1>

    <p>
      Every agricultural trade moves through a corridor with its own realities. Tariffs change, ports slow down, weather disrupts rail, and geopolitical conditions shift without warning. GANT’s risk intelligence framework was designed to help buyers and governments operate confidently in this environment. Instead of reacting after disruptions occur, the system provides a clear view of corridor stability before and during every shipment.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding Corridors</h2>
    <p>
      A corridor is the pathway your goods travel from our facility to your country. It includes the rail route, the port terminal, and the ocean lane leading to your destination. Each corridor carries risks that are entirely outside the farmer’s or buyer’s control, but deeply relevant to the outcome of trade. Our responsibility is to make these risks visible in a structured, decision-ready way.
    </p>

    <h2>The Corridor Risk Engine</h2>
    <p>
      The Corridor Risk Engine (CRE) summarizes publicly available information into a simple signal that buyers can use when placing bids. It evaluates three types of macro conditions:
      <br><br>
      • <strong>Tariff and regulatory environment</strong> including sudden duties, restrictions, or policy changes.<br>
      • <strong>Geopolitical developments</strong> such as conflicts, strikes, instability, and regional disruptions reported by reliable news agencies.<br>
      • <strong>Environmental conditions</strong> that could impact transport or export operations.
      <br><br>
      The result is a corridor-level stability score used to confirm whether a trade can proceed. Buyers do not need to interpret raw data, search for news, or follow multiple channels. The CRE consolidates and simplifies the information for them.
    </p>

    <h2>The Dynamic Shipment Risk Engine</h2>
    <p>
      Once a shipment leaves our facility, the Dynamic Shipment Risk Engine (DSRE) monitors its journey. It combines container sensor readings with publicly available operational data from ports and rail networks. The goal is to give buyers a reliable summary of how their shipment behaved in transit.
    </p>

    <p>The DSRE evaluates four risk areas:</p>

    <p>
      • <strong>Environmental conditions inside the container</strong> (temperature and humidity behaviour over time) – 35 percent of the score.<br>
      • <strong>Movement and route alignment</strong> including prolonged stops, unexpected diversions, or physical shock alerts – 25 percent.<br>
      • <strong>Macro conditions from the corridor</strong> such as geopolitical or environmental events affecting the route – 25 percent.<br>
      • <strong>Port and rail operational performance</strong> drawn from publicly available sources – 15 percent.
    </p>

    <p>
      The DSRE does not overwhelm buyers with raw numbers. Instead, it provides a single risk colour with a concise interpretation:
      <br><br>
      • <strong>Green (0–30 percent)</strong> – No significant issues detected.<br>
      • <strong>Yellow (31–60 percent)</strong> – Minor deviations or environmental fluctuation.<br>
      • <strong>Orange (61–75 percent)</strong> – Noticeable behaviour that may require review.<br>
      • <strong>Red (76 percent and above)</strong> – Significant deviations or multiple alerts.
    </p>

    <h2>How Buyers Use This Information</h2>
    <p>
      Corridor intelligence is used before bidding. Shipment intelligence is used after your goods are dispatched. Together, these tools help buyers strengthen internal compliance, improve procurement decisions, and resolve disputes more efficiently. The result is a more predictable trade environment and a clearer understanding of how each shipment performed.
    </p>

    <h2>Aligned With Real Trade, Not Theory</h2>
    <p>
      Both systems are built for practical application. We only use data that is legitimately obtainable and ethically accessible. There is no proprietary surveillance, no private tracking beyond the container device placed inside your shipment, and no sensitive information exposed. Buyers get exactly what they need: visibility, assurance, and an objective record of the corridor and the shipment they purchased.
